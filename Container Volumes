The data dosent persist when that container no longer exists 
and it can be difficult to get the data out of the container if another process needs it.

A container's writable layer is tightly coupled to the host machine where the container is running.
you cant easily move the data somewhere else.

Docker has two options for containers to store files in the host machine.

- Volumes
   managed by docker (/var/lib/docker/volumes/  )  on linux.
   
- Bind Mounts
   Stored anywhere on the host system
   
   
   
Ex: 
   
 Step 1
   
    docker pull mysql:5.7
   
 Step 2
   
   run command   
     docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
mysql        5.7       2a0961b7de03   2 weeks ago   462MB

docker inspect mysql:5.7

We have to check the following -
Container ID
Hosts
Exposed port
ENV
Volumes
CMD
Entrypoint
